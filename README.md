# OOP Calculator

A Python-based calculator implemented using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. This project demonstrates the power of OOP in creating structured, reusable, and efficient code for performing basic arithmetic operations.

## Features
- **Core Arithmetic Operations**: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles invalid inputs and division by zero.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Encapsulates functionality in classes for better code organization and reusability.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need:
- Python 3.7 or higher

## Running the Program
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fexilgonzo/OOPCalculator.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd OOPCalculator
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python oop_calculator.py
   ```

## Future Enhancements
- Add advanced mathematical operations such as power and modulus.
- Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter for improved user interaction.

## About
This project is an example of how Object-Oriented Programming can be applied to build modular and maintainable Python applications.
